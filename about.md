<p> Brad is currently pursuing a PhD in Computational Psychology and Cognitive Science at Indiana University. His primary research interest is investigating how people make predictions about uncertain situations. This involves applying probabilistic models to reasoning process that aren't usually considered logical or rational--such as analogy, possibility, or counterfactuals. He is also interested in how people learn through inspecting existing knowledge rather than by collecting new evidence or observation--such as through analysis, thought experiments, or science fiction. He is enamored by analytic approaches such as Bayesian estimation, Information Theory, theories on complexity, reinforcement learning, and model selection.</p>
